# N-layer-Neural-Network
Created a N layer Neural Network by my own without any frameworks or APIs

utils.py -> This file consists of the activation functions that I used in the neural net.

model.py -> Here all the functions relates to the complete iteration of the forward and backward propagation are included along with the cost function.
It also includes the predict() used for predicting the output using the updated parameters.

main.py -> It includes the structure of the workig of the Neural Net by using the functions for model and utils files. 

This is a simple Neural Net and can't give accurate results on image data. We can try it for Mnist-image dataset as the images are very small and doesn't require Conv and pooling layers.
This network can be used for solving an equation or can be used for finding the outpput to the 6 logical gates studied in electronics.
