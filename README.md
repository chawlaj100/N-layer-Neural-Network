# N-layer-Neural-Network
N layer neural network without using library functions(only used numpy).

- utils.py -> This file consists of the activation functions that used in the neural net.

- model.py -> Here all the functions related to completing one full iteration combining the forward and backward propagation are included along with the cost function.
It also includes the predict() used for predicting the output using the updated parameters.

- main.py -> It includes Neural Net architecture where all the functions from model and utils are used. 

### This is a simple Neural Net and can't give accurate results on image data. We can try it for Mnist-image dataset as the images are very small and doesn't require Conv and pooling layers.
#### This network can be used for solving a polynomial equation or can be used for finding the output to the 6 logical gates namely AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, XOR.
